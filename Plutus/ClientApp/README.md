## Web build
To get the web build running you will need Node installed.

You can then run `npm ci` in this directory (`Plutus/Plutus/ClientApp`)

The web build will then work via the main Rider build, or you can run `npm start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you're having problems with certain versions, searching with this in mind will help.
